This is my Ironhack Module 1 final work. It's a game created in Canvas using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The inspiration came from this game that I found online: https://saint-modo.itch.io/motorbike. 

You can play the game here: https://project-1-the-game-l64oi55s3-deoliveirajuan.vercel.app/ I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ›µ
